Science Fiction (often shortened to Sci-Fi or SF) is a genre of speculative fiction that typically deals with imaginative and futuristic concepts such as advanced science and technology, space exploration, time travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. It has been called the "literature of ideas", and often explores the potential consequences of scientific, social, and technological innovations.

## What is Science Fiction?

Science Fiction is a genre that uses speculative, fictional science-based depictions of phenomena that are not fully accepted by mainstream science, such as extraterrestrial lifeforms, alien worlds, extrasensory perception, and time travel, along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft, robots, cyborgs, interstellar travel, or other technologies. Science fiction narratives explore alternative realities and future possibilities, asking "what if?" questions that challenge our understanding of the universe and our place within it.

## Origins of Science Fiction

Science fiction's roots go back as far as ancient times, but the genre as we understand it today began to take shape during the Age of Enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries. Early works often involved elements of speculation and the supernatural, the limits of reason, and the ideals of scientific progress. The term "Science Fiction" was popularized, if not invented, in the 1920s by one of the genreâ€™s principal advocates, the American publisher Hugo Gernsback.

## Influence on Movies and TV

Science Fiction has had a profound influence on film and television, with numerous iconic franchises such as 'Star Wars', 'Star Trek', and 'Doctor Who' becoming deeply embedded in popular culture. These narratives often delve into the implications of technological and scientific advances, the exploration of space, and the potential for contact with other lifeforms.
