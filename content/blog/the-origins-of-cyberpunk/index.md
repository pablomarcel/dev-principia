Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction that has significantly influenced pop culture, particularly in movies, books, video games, and even fashion. It explores the intersection of technology, society, and identity in the near future, often presenting a dystopian view of a society where technology has advanced far more rapidly than our moral and social frameworks.

## What is Cyberpunk?

Cyberpunk presents a future world where there is a stark contrast between high tech and low life. It explores the social issues that arise when advanced technology is accessible to a desperate society willing to misuse it. Cyberpunk narratives often involve hackers, AI, mega-corporations, and a networked world.

## Origins of Cyberpunk

The term 'Cyberpunk' was coined by Bruce Bethke in his 1983 short story 'Cyberpunk'. However, the themes that define cyberpunk can be traced back to earlier works. Authors like Philip K. Dick and J.G. Ballard laid the groundwork with their stories that explored altered states, dystopian futures, and the impact of technology on society.
